	The Azure SDK delivers a platform for developers to leverage the wide variety of Azure services in their language of choice. The source for the client libraries exists for the most part in repositories for each language. This repository is meant to be a jumping off point into those language specific repositories. Issues related to a specific language should be opened in the corresponding repository but cross cutting issues can be opened in this repository.<br><br>

	🇺🇸 - **SDK**: Software Development Kit. This refers to the entire Azure SDK for a single language, itself broken up into numerous Azure SDK _Client Libraries_ (as defined below).<br>
	<br>
	
	
	{% endraw %}
	
	✅ line 24<br>{% raw %}
	- **Client Library**. This refers to a library (and associated tools, documentation, and samples) that customers/developers use to ease working with an Azure service. There is often one client library per service and per programming language. Sometimes a single client library will contain the ability to connect to multiple services. Each client library is published separately to the appropriate language-specific package repository.  These releases are performed exclusively by the Azure SDK engineering systems team. Customers/Developers consume and use each client library separately as necessary to solve their use case.<br><br>

			🇺🇸 **On 31 March 2023, we will be deprecating Azure SDK libraries which do not conform to our [current Azure SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html).** The new Azure SDK libraries are updated regularly to drive consistent experiences and strengthen your security posture. Please transition to the new Azure SDK libraries to take advantage of the new capabilities and critical security updates before 31 March 2023.<br>

If you prefer not to transition to the new Azure SDK libraries, source code for the current Azure SDKs libraries will still be available on GitHub as open source. You can continue to use the code and apply your own fixes, as required.<br>

			One of the key things we want to support is to allow consumers of the library to easily write repeatable unit-tests for their applications without activating a service. This allows them to reliably and quickly test their code without worrying about the vagaries of the underlying service implementation (including, for example, network conditions or service outages). Mocking is also helpful to simulate failures, edge cases, and hard to reproduce situations (for example: does code work on February 29th).<br><br>
			---------------------<br><br>
			우리가 지원하고 싶은 핵심 사항 중 하나는 라이브러리 이용자가 서비스를 활성화하지 않고도 애플리케이션에 대해 반복 가능한 유닛 테스트를 쉽게 작성할 수 있도록 하는 것입니다. 이는 기반이 되는 서비스 구현의 예상 밖의 문제(네트워크의 상태나 서비스의 정지등)에 대해 염려하지 않고, 코드를 확실하고 빠르게 테스트할 수 있습니다. 모의 객체는 장애, 엣지 케이스, 재현하기 어려운 상황(코드가 2월 29일에는 작동하지 않는 경우)을 시뮬레이트하는데도 도움이 됩니다.<br><br>

			🇺🇸 While API usability is the primary reason for subclients, another motivating factor is resource efficiency.  [Clients need to be cached](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/lifetime-management-and-thread-safety-guarantees-of-azure-sdk-net-clients/), so if the set of client instances is large or unlimited (in case the client takes a scoping parameter, like a hub, or a container), using subclients allows an application to cache the top level client and create instances of subclients on demand.  In addition, if there is an expensive shared resource (e.g. an AMQP connection), subclients are preferred, as they naturally lead to resource sharing.<br>

			🇺🇸 In many cases, an Azure SDK API should contain one service client and zero or more subclients.  Both service clients and subclients have [service methods](#dotnet-client-methods).  Consider adding more than one service client to the API in the following cases:<br>

			✅ line 356<br>{% raw %}
	
			🇺🇸 For example, the Azure Form Recognizer library provides a `FormRecognizerClient` for application developers to read form fields in their applications, and a `FormTrainingClient` for data scientist customers to train the form recognition models.<br>

			🇺🇸 For example, the Azure Storage Blobs library provides a `BlockBlobClient` in the `Azure.Storage.Blobs.Specialized` namespace that gives finer grained control of how blobs are uploaded.

			There are many reasons why failure can occur when a client application attempts to send a network request to a service. Some examples are timeout, network infrastructure failures, service rejecting the request due to throttle/busy, service instance terminating due to service scale-down, service instance going down to be replaced with another version, service crashing due to an unhandled exception, etc. By offering a built-in retry mechanism (with a default configuration the consumer can override), our SDKs and the consumer's application become resilient to these kinds of failures. Note that some services charge real money for each try and so consumers should be able to disable retries entirely if they prefer to save money over resiliency.<br><br>
			---------------------<br><br>
			클라이언트 애플리케이션이 서비스에 네트워크 요청을 보내려고 할 때 오류가 발생하는 데에는 여러 이유가 있습니다. 몇 가지 예로는 시간 초과, 네트워크 인프라 오류, 제한/사용 중으로 인한 서비스 거부, 스케일 다운으로 인한 서비스 인스턴스 종료, 다른 버전으로 교체하기 위해 다운되는 서비스 인스턴스, 처리되지 않은 예외로 인한 서비스 충돌 등이 있습니다. 기본 제공 재시도 메커니즘(소비자가 재정의할 수 있는 기본 구성)을 제공함으로써 SDK와 소비자 애플리케이션은 이러한 장애에 탄력적으로 대처할 수 있습니다. 일부 서비스는 각 시도에 대해 실제 비용을 청구하므로, 소비자가 복원력보다 비용 절감을 선호하는 경우 재시도를 완전히 비활성화할 수 있어야 합니다.<br><br>

Conceptually there are two entities responsible for authenticating service client requests, a credential and an authentication policy.  Credentials provide confidential authentication data needed to authenticate requests.  Authentication policies use the data provided by a credential to authenticate requests to the service. It is essential that credential data can be updated as needed across the lifetime of a client, and authentication policies must always use the most current credential data.<br><br>

			Distributed tracing allows the consumer to trace their code from frontend to backend.  The distributed tracing library creates spans (units of unique work) to facilitate tracing.  Each span is in a parent-child relationship.  As you go deeper into the hierarchy of code, you create more spans.  These spans can then be exported to a suitable receiver as needed.  Spans must follow [Tracing Conventions].  To keep track of the spans, a _distributed tracing context_ (called a context within the rest of this section) is passed into each successive layer.  For more information on this topic, visit the [OpenTelemetry] topic on tracing.<br><br>

			🇺🇸 These are typically used to prevent losing updates in an optimistic concurrency scenario, i.e. I've modified the cached value I'm holding, but don't update the service version unless it has the same copy I've got. These return either a success or a 412 error status code, indicating the value was modified, to indicate to the caller that they'll need to retry their update if they want it to succeed.<br>

			🇺🇸 The `withOptions` field provides preconditions to the HTTP request. The Etag value will be retrieved from the item that is passed into the method where possible, and method arguments where not possible. The form of the method will be modified based on idiomatic usage patterns in the language of choice. In cases where the ETag value is not known, the operation cannot be conditional. If the library developer does not need to support advanced usage of precondition headers, they can add a boolean parameter that is set to true to establish the condition. For example, use one of the following boolean names instead of the conditions operator:<br>

			🇺🇸 The return value from a conditional operation must be carefully considered. For safe operators (e.g. GET), return a response that will throw if the value is accessed (or follow the same convention used for a 204 No Content response), since there is no value in the body to reference. For unsafe operators (e.g. PUT, DELETE, or POST), throw a specific error when a Precondition Failed or Conflict result is received. This allows the consumer to do something different in the case of conflicting results.<br>

			Distributed tracing mechanisms allow the consumer to trace their code from frontend to backend.  Distributed tracing libraries creates spans - units of unique work.  Each span is in a parent-child relationship.  As you go deeper into the hierarchy of code, you create more spans.  These spans can then be exported to a suitable receiver as needed.  To keep track of the spans, a _distributed tracing context_ (called a context in the remainder of this section) is passed into each successive layer.

			In general each pipeline that ships a library (or set of libraries) to customers should be optimized to perform necessary build, test and static analysis steps for just that set of libraries.

			The azure-sdk language repositories will sometimes contain modules/libraries/packages which provide integration between popular application frameworks as Azure services. For example Spring Boot, Spring Data, or ASP.NET. In general the modules that provide integration with a specific service should be co-located with the other modules for that service. In very limited circumstances an application framework may contains shared logic used across multiple integrations, or all integrations are in a single module. In those cases the module may be placed in a directory named after the application framework (e.g. ```sdk/spring/```).<br><br>
