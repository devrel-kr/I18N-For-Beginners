"A method called `getName()` is short, but may leave some doubt in the users "
"mind about which name is being represented. Instead, naming this method "
"`getLinkName()` will remove all doubt from the users mind, and without "
"substantial additional verbosity. Similarly, in the case of `getId()` above,"
" always choose to specify the identifier name if there is any likelihood of "
"confusion about which identifier is being referenced. For example, use "
"`getTenantId()` rather than `getId()`, unless it is completely unambiguous "
"as to which identifier is being referenced."
